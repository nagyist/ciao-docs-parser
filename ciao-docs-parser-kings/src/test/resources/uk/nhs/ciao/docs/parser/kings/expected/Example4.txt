No evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement. Abdomen: Unremarkable appearances of the liver, biliary tree, pancreas, spleen and the kidneys. No focal abnormality is noted. No evidence of mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement. No evidence of free fluid. Normal appearances of the unprepared small and large bowel. Unremarkable appearances noted within the pelvis and the retroperitoneum. No focal skeletal abnormalities are noted. Conclusion: Abnormal enlargement of the oesophagus with delayed emptying/reflux. Although this may be due to achalasia distal gastro-oesophageal junction lesion cannot be completely excluded. OGD is recommended if this is clinically feasible. The lung parenchymal changes are most likely to be in keeping with recurrent aspiration. No radiological evidence to suggest intra-abdominal or pelvic malignancy.",
